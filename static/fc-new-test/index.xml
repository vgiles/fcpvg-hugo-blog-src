      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Vincent Giles, an Australian composer born in 1985 and based in Naarm (Melbourne). My work explores the fragile boundaries of perception, the beauty in instability, and those fascinating glitches that emerge from both human and machine creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My music has traveled across North America, Europe, South-East Asia, and throughout Australia, brought to life by incredible performers like Peter Sheridan, Lizzy Welsh, Alice Bennett, Halfsound, Arcko Symphonic Ensemble, and Fragments Ensemble. You might have heard my work at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse, Tura Totally Huge New Music Festival, various Fringe Festivals in Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle, or during the Impulse Festival and Academy for New Music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
