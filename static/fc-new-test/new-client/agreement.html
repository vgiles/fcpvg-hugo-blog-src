<h1 id="freelance-client-engagement">Freelance Client Engagement</h1>
<p>This agreement is between Vincent Giles, owner and operator of Faulty Cat Productions (hereafter referred to as "FCP"), and You, "The Client", or the authorised representative thereof (hereafter referred to by "{client name}"), for the work commencing as per the agreed engagement.</p>
<h2 id="plain-language-summary">Plain Language Summary</h2>
<p>In short, this written agreement states the conditions of engagement of FCP by {client name}, including conditions of pay (as per quote and relevant laws) and payment, minimum charges for service, minimum cancellation conditions for both FCP and {client name}, limitations of liability and indemnity (standard stuff), and protections for the intellectual property of both FCP and {client name}. All straight forward stuff designed to protect both parties. Also, things happen, so just keep in communication.</p>
<h2 id="quoteestimate-details">Quote/Estimate Details</h2>
<p>Quote/Estimate/Invoice Number: {invoice number} Please refer to this for specifics around fees and hours if relevant.</p>
<h2 id="agreed-hourly-rate">Agreed Hourly Rate</h2>
<p>The agreed hourly rate of work to be carried out during normal business hours (0900/9:00am to 1700/5:00pm) will be negotiated between {client name} and FCP before work commences, and is described in the estimate {reference number}. The agreed hourly rate is to remain confidential between {client name} and FCP. FCP reserves the right to change this rate, but will not do so without informing {client name} in the unlikely event that the rate is to be changed during the term of this agreement, in writing, with advance notice of no less than two weeks than the expected change of rate date.</p>
<h2 id="overtime-rate">Overtime Rate</h2>
<p>The overtime rate is applicable outside the normal business hours of 0900/9:00am to 1700/5:00pm, Monday to Friday. The overtime rate also applies to any hours that are in surplus of 38 hours per working week, and any hours that are worked on weekends and public holidays (national and/or state). Overtime rates will only be charged when {client name} or their representative has directly requested work to be done during these hours. Where deadlines are set and the work required exceeds the estimated scheduled time, falling into overtime hours, {client name} will be notified before any work is undertaken at this rate.</p>
<h2 id="superannuation-guarantee">Superannuation Guarantee</h2>
<p>In the situation where FCP’s commitment to {client name} exceeds AU$450 in a calendar month, FCP is considered an employee of {client name} for the purposes of Superannuation Guarantee. Reflecting this, the resulting invoice will include a contribution of <strong>10%</strong>, and the relevant Super account details, on the invoice. This has been factored in to the hourly rate anyway, and so no additional money needs to be paid. {client name} does however need to pay this amount directly into the Superannuation account.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-charge">Minimum Charge</h2>
<p>In the situation where FCP is required to work continuously for {client name} in a single day, FCP has a minimum daily fee of the equivalent of four (4) hours work. This means that if a client requests work be done over two days to a tight deadline, then <em>at minimum</em> the client would be charged eight hours, over two days. Hours required beyond this minimum will be billed hourly. Transport to and from a client’s site is <em>included</em> within this minimum booking time, provided it is within a reasonable 45-minute radius from the FCP base of work. Additional travel time will be billed separately at a separate rate.</p>
<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
<p>FCP invoices weekly. Payment is expected by bank transfer (Osko or standard), within fourteen (14) days (inclusive of weekends and/or public holidays) of receipt of the invoice from FCP. Failure to pay within this period will be notified with a reminder and a seven (7) day grace period. Failure to pay beyond this time will result in legal action. GST inclusivity or exclusivity is indicated by the invoice or quote.</p>
<h2 id="general-client-responsibilities">General Client Responsibilities</h2>
<p>{the client} takes responsibility to provide FCP any specific or specialist tools, resources, etc. beyond what can be reasonably expected of FCP.</p>
<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
<p>It is agreed by both FCP and {client name} that in the event of confidential information being made available to and/or by either party, both parties agree not to misuse or disclose any of this information without appropriate consent, and never for the purpose of profit.</p>
<h2 id="liability-and-indemnity">Liability and Indemnity</h2>
<p>FCP makes every effort to maintain the highest possible work standards, however cannot accept responsibility for any loss, expense or liability of any kind incurred whilst preparing work for {client name} in a freelance capacity. To the extent permitted by law, FCP shall not be liable to {client name} or to any third party for any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly in connection with the provision of services. {client name} will indemnify and holds harmless the Consultant from and against any claims, costs, expenses, negligence, actions or suits suffered, sustained or incurred by {client name} or any third party. This includes, without limitation, interruptions caused by acts of Nature, or any other circumstances beyond reasonable control, any lost profits, business interruption, loss of data or otherwise, even if expressly advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed, all intellectual property to which FCP/Vincent Giles is entitled is maintained in perpetuity. This agreement, however, grants {client name} a license to use the generated intellectual property for the sole purpose of {project name}. This clause can be overridden by a specific intellectual property license, if appropriate. Any intellectual property of {client name} to which FCP becomes privileged remains the property of {client name} unless otherwise agreed and covered by a separate agreement.</p>
<h2 id="revision-policy">Revision Policy</h2>
<p>If appropriate to the work being undertaken by FCP, and if desired by {client name} FCP will provide regular communication as to work-in-progress for feedback by {client name} in the early stages of development. This will include two consultative processes of revision with the intention of meeting {client name}’s needs without the need for revision. Once the final version is submitted, FCP will provide three (3) additional minor revisions without additional charge. Revisions after this will be billed on an hourly basis, and major revisions will be considered a commencement of a new project.</p>
<h2 id="cancellation-termination-of-agreement">Cancellation / Termination of Agreement</h2>
<p>FCP insists on a minimum of 48 hours notice by {client name} for cancellations of work. Cancellation within 48 hours of the start of the work will still be invoiced at the minimum rate of pay. In the event of cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances, negotiation can take place to reschedule the service, if appropriate. In the instance that FCP wishes to cancel the agreement with {client name}, then all effort will be made to provide at least seven (7) days notice prior to the commencement of work (if that much time is available between contract signing and commencement, otherwise the longest time possible before commencement), or fourteen (14) days notice once the work has commenced. In the event that {client name} wishes to cancel an agreement with FCP, then they agree to at least seven (7) days notice prior to the commencement of work, or as close to that as possible after the agreement is made, or fourteen (14) days notice once the work has commenced.</p>
